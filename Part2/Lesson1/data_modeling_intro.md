## Data modeling

- Process to support business and user applications
- Gather requirements
- Conceptual data modeling
- Logical data modeling
- Physical data modeling


## Key points 
- Data Organization: The organization of the data for your applications is extremely important and makes everyone's life easier.
- Use cases: Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later be used. Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling isn't well thought out.
- Starting early: Thinking and planning ahead will help you be successful. This is not something you want to leave until the last minute.
- Iterative Process: Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.
