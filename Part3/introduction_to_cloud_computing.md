## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing: the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

## AWS
Amazon Web Services is one of the largest providers in the cloud computing industry, with over 140 services in compute, storage, databases, networking, developer tools, security, and more. These services can be accessed in three different ways: 
- AWS Management Console
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Software Development Kits (SDKs)
