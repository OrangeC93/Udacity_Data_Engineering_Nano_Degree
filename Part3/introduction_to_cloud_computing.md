## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing: the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

## AWS
Amazon Web Services is one of the largest providers in the cloud computing industry, with over 140 services in compute, storage, databases, networking, developer tools, security, and more. These services can be accessed in three different ways: 
- AWS Management Console
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Software Development Kits (SDKs)

- Attach to your Redshift cluster to enable your cluster to load data from Amazon S3 buckets

Launch a redshift cluster

Create an IAM User
- Use to access your Redshift cluster

Delete a Redsihift Cluster
- Make sure to delete your cluster each time you're finished working to avoid large, unexpected costs. You can always launch a new cluster, so don't leave it running overnight or throughout the week if you don't need to
